Objective:
Develop a Java application that integrates image and PDF processing. This project will utilize Maven for managing dependencies and Git for version control. The final code should be hosted on GitHub.
1. Project Requirements:
Allow users to input a short signature (2 or 3 characters).
Implement functionality to overlay this signature onto pre-stored stamp images (stamps) included in your project resources.
Include an option for users to specify the location of a PDF file. The program will then place the signature stamp in the bottom left corner of the PDF, creating a new file version with the added stamp.
2. Research and Integration:
Research and integrate Java libraries suitable for image and PDF processing from the Maven Repository.
Ensure the chosen libraries are compatible with your project requirements.
3. Development and Version Control:
Use Git for version control, making regular commits with clear descriptions of changes.
4. Final Submission:
Create a new repository in your GitHub account.
Push your completed project to this GitHub repository.
Submit the GitHub repository link via Google Classroom.
